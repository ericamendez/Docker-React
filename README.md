# Creating Production Grade Workflow

## Things I Learned:
### Containerizing React App
- How to build image in React app by adding a `Dockerfile.dev` file in root directory and running the command `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .` with the flag -f specifying the file we will use to build out the image.


### Docker Volumes
- Setting up Docker volumes to allow the docker container to reference files in my local machine, (and update changes immediately when made on my local machine). First build the image `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev` then run command `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v ${pwd}:/app CONTAINER_ID`
    - `-v /app/node_modules` putting a bookmark on the node_modules folder (placeholder for a folder that is inside the container)
    - `-v ${pwd}:/app`
        - `-v` used to set up a volume
        - `$(pwd)` shortcut to the path of present working directory in machine
        - `:` we are saying we want to map up a folder outside a container to a folder inside a container
- How configure docker volumes in `docker-compose.yml` file so that we won't have to run the long command mentioned above. We could just do that all in docker-compose and run `docker-compose up` to build image and run it.


### Running React Test
- Build React app & run test in Docker with `docker -it <CONTAINER_ID> npm run test` command.
- Since we have a container created specifically to run test, we need to set up volume stuff in this container as well so that we can live update test. How to fix that:
    - Run the test inside of our docker-compose instance (that already has that the volumes mappings set up). (need to remember the container id)
        - `docker-compose up`
        - `docker ps` and get container id
        - `docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> npm run test`
    - Add second service to `docker-compose.yml` file that is solely responsible for running our test suite (get all the output of test log in interface of docker-compose, also we won't be able to manipulate the running test suite)
        - `test:
               build: 
                   context: .
                   dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
               volumes:
                   - /app/node_modules
                   - .:/app
               command: ["npm", "run", "test"]`
        - Run with `docker-compose up --build`

### Building React App in Production
- In development environment we have a dev server that sends the http request the `index.html` and `main.js` files to the browser. In production, this dev server does not exist because it is not appropriate to be running in production environment (has a lot of proccessing power dedicated to processing constantly changing `index.html` and `main.js` files, which we will not need in production since we aren't making changes).
- We will use server nginx, takes incoming traffic and routing to it with some static files. 
- Create a seperate Dockerfile that will create a production version of our web container with a nginx server.
    - docker hub has a nginx image, we will be doing a multi step build process for our production container.

### Continuous Integration (with Travis CI) and Deployment with AWS
- We will be using Travis CI so we will configure a `.tavis.yml` file to let Travis know we want docker installed and specify the seriies of commands to execute before the test are ran.
